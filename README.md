# The-Lambda-Project
A collaborative project for the students of the Lambda Full Stack Web Development course.

## Directions
To collaborate on this project, simply clone and create your own branch of this repository. YOU DO NOT NEED TO FORK IT. Then, create your own folder with your name on it. This is where your code and all needed files will go. When your code has been pushed, create a pull request and I will review. Upon reviewing, the code will be added to the live site. You will notice other students' code as well as a main index file. DO NOT edit these files, only edit your own. Code that is not yours and has been edited will result in a rejected pull request.
